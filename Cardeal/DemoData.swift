             description: "In February 2021, Porsche introduced the 992's GT3 version. Like most other GT3 Porsches, It is intended for mixed usage with a more track focused setup. It uses the same 4.0 litre naturally aspirated flat-6 as its predecessor, albeit producing 510 BHP. It reaches 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.4 seconds while the top speed is 320 km/h (199 mph). The 992 GT3 is touted to have a sub-7 minute Nurburgring lap time. Unlike the standard model, the GT3 features a large rear spoiler with larger air vents, a bigger diffuser, two large exhaust connections, bucket seats in its interior, and an optional roll cage.",
